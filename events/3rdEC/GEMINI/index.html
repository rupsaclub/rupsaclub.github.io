<h1>GEMINI Project Analysis</h1>
<h2>Directory Overview</h2>
<p>This directory appears to be for a non-code project, likely a static website for &quot;RUPSA&quot; (presumably Rajshahi University Philosophy Students' Association). It serves as a repository for events organized by the 3rd Executive Committee (EC). The structure is organized by event, with each event having its own folder containing images and a markdown file with event details.</p>
<h2>Key Files</h2>
<p>The most important files in this directory are the <code>index.md</code> files within each event's subdirectory. These files contain metadata about each event in YAML front matter, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>layout</code>: Specifies the template to use (e.g., <code>event.njk</code>).</li>
<li><code>title</code>: The title of the event.</li>
<li><code>date</code>: The date of the event.</li>
<li><code>description</code>: A brief description of the event.</li>
<li><code>featured</code>: The main image for the event.</li>
<li><code>images</code>: A list of all images for the event.</li>
<li><code>tags</code>: Tags associated with the event (e.g., <code>3rd EC</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The body of the markdown file provides a brief description of the event.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The contents of this directory are likely used by a static site generator (such as Eleventy) to build a website. The <code>index.md</code> files are processed, and the data is used to populate the event pages of the website.</p>
<p>To add a new event, you would create a new directory, add the images, and create an <code>index.md</code> file with the appropriate metadata.</p>
