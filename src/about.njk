            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Rajshahi University Philosophy Students’ Association (RUPSA) is more than just a student organization—it
                is a space of thought, dialogue, and collective aspiration. Founded by the students of the Department of
                Philosophy at the University of Rajshahi, RUPSA serves as a vibrant platform where young minds meet,
                ideas evolve, and voices rise in unison to confront the questions of our time.
            </p>
            <p>
                At its core, RUPSA is rooted in the intellectual legacy of Rajshahi University, one of the oldest and
                most prestigious institutions in Bangladesh. Inheriting a tradition of rigorous philosophical inquiry,
                our association seeks to carry that tradition forward—not merely through academic engagement but by
                transforming philosophical values into lived experiences, critical action, and ethical leadership.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to foster a spirit of critical inquiry, ethical reflection, and intellectual independence
                among students of philosophy. We aim to equip our peers not only with academic tools, but also with the
                emotional and moral intelligence to navigate a rapidly changing world. We believe that philosophy has
                the power to challenge injustice, question inherited norms, and illuminate paths toward a more
                thoughtful and inclusive society.</p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>RUPSA envisions a university community where philosophical thinking is not confined to theory, but
                translated into empathy, leadership, and action. We strive to cultivate students who are not only
                well-versed in philosophical texts, but also grounded in the reality of human experiences—students who
                can listen, speak, write, and act with integrity and vision.

                We imagine a society where the practice of philosophy is integrated into civic life, education,
                governance, and interpersonal relationships. As an association, we see ourselves as a small but
                committed part of that broader transformation.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2>Our Identity</h2>
            <p>RUPSA is led entirely by students, for students. Our diverse body includes thinkers, writers, organizers,
                and change-makers who are united by a shared commitment to academic growth, social justice, and moral
                responsibility. We are guided by the belief that philosophy is not limited to classrooms—it lives in
                conversations, communities, and the everyday choices we make.

                Whether it's facilitating debates on ethics and politics, commemorating philosophical figures, engaging
                in social initiatives, or organizing seminars with scholars and practitioners, RUPSA remains active
                throughout the academic calendar, both within the department and across the university landscape.</p>

            <h2>Our Legacy & Future</h2>
            <p>Over the years, RUPSA has grown into a trusted platform within the Department of Philosophy—respected for
                its integrity, inclusiveness, and consistency. From internal events to national-level engagements, our
                members have represented RUPSA with excellence and responsibility.

                As we look ahead, we remain grounded in the values that brought us together: respect for knowledge,
                commitment to justice, openness to dialogue, and belief in the transformative power of youth. With every
                new member, every new idea, and every small success, we inch closer to our dream of building a
                thoughtful, humane, and conscious society—starting from Rajshahi, reaching outward.</p>
